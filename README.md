## OKRs (Objectives & Key Results) Toolkit
- [OKR Template](https://github.com/strategyhacks/StrategyHacks_Toolkit/blob/main/Template_OKR%20Tracker.xlsx). The OKR template can be used as a zero cost way of starting out. Tab one has a nice summary diagram of the cascade from Vision to Objectives to OKRs, the second tab has a template for building up your quarterly OKRs. Create a new tab for each team / individual and work on them together.

## Strategy Map ##
- [Strategy Map Template v0.1](https://github.com/strategyhacks/StrategyHacks_Toolkit/blob/main/Template_StrategyMap.pptx) - A VERY basic starting point. More to come. 

#### Examples: ####
- [CEO Strategy Map](https://www.intrafocus.com/2016/09/ceo-strategy-map/) - Nice Strategy map, with metrics. Also has vision, mission & values wrapped around it. 
- [Strategy Map for Security Leaders](https://sujeet.bambawale.com/2016/01/18/a-strategy-map-for-security-leaders/) - Pre-populated with some aspects of Security management.
- [Healthcare example](https://www.24point0.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/products-health-diagram-presentations-template_1.jpg) - A slightly different approach, but quite inspiring wording examples.
